## Testing

A unit test suite is included for testing PHP code. To use it you will need `phpunit` and to generate the PSR-4 autoload map. This can be done using `composer`. To get `composer` follow the instructions for your os on https://getcomposer.org. With `composer` installed, simply change into the project directory and run `composer install`. You can then run tests using `phpunit` installed by `composer`.

```sh
cd ${PROJECT_DIRECTORY}
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit test
```
